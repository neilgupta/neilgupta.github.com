# My Design Process

## Setup

Get a whiteboard if working in a group or a notebook if solo. Expect it to get messy.

## Problem Statement

Understand the problem being solved. Without a clear problem, you end up creating a solution in search of a problem.

> Cars are black boxes for most people. In particular, the check engine light is a car owner's worst nightmare. It is an enigma that could mean expensive engine work or just that the gas cap is loose.

## Target User

Choose a specific target user to design for. You'll never make everybody happy, but you can make some people love you. Focus on those people.

> Our target users are young professionals who have bought their first car and can't afford unforeseen expenses on it. They do not know anything about car engines but have smartphones.

## User Research

Figure out what the target user does now to solve the problem. This step involves talking to prospective users and collecting responses. Analyze the data to find patterns.

> If the check engine light turns on, users generally ignore the problem for as long as possible and pray the car keeps working. Eventually they take their car to a mechanic for a diagnosis and quote. They have to trust the mechanic because they don't know what's reasonable.

## Task Analysis

Codify user behavior and thought process.

## Competitive Analysis

Assess the strengths and weaknesses of competitors.

## Feature Analysis

Determine the most important tasks by usage frequency and prioritize them when designing the wireframes and choosing features for the MVP.

## Storyboard

Illustrate typical use case scenarios of when and why the user will use the product.

## User Flow

Visualize how the product will be used from start to finish.

## Wireframe

Low-fidelity mockups of layout. The primary goal is to work on UX, the visual design will come later.

## Rapid Prototyping

Use the wireframes and [Marvel](http://marvelapp.com) to create a low-fidelity prototype suitable for user testing.

## Mockup

High-fidelity mockups to flesh out the visual design.

## Minimum Viable Product

Build the most basic version of the product possible that can still be used by customers to solve the problem. If you are not embarassed by your MVP, you worked on it too long.
