It was an exciting day today at the Apple store opening. Aside from seeing Apple umbrellas and getting completely seduced by the new MacBook Air, I met Rahm Emanuel, Obama's ex-Chief of Staff, in line at the opening. I can now add him to my list of famous people I've physically met, which I mentally began after meeting Hugh Jackman two years ago.
