<p>Found on a San Diego beach, the attention to detail in this sand castle is beyond ridiculous. The creator places each layer of sand one inch at a time to get that level of detail. He&rsquo;s been building sand castles for nearly two decades. He started when his kids were toddlers, and just kept doing it even after his kids left for college and moved on. His passion shows. The beach was covered in similar castles that he had been building all day just for fun.</p>
