Yesterday, news broke that Apple is introducing content blocker extensions to Safari in iOS 9. Hereâ€™s how [Apple's developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014305-CH9-SW9) puts the new change, coming in iOS 9:

> The new Safari release brings Content Blocking Safari Extensions to iOS. Content Blocking gives your extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content.

[Everybody](http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/06/a-blow-for-mobile-advertising-the-next-version-of-safari-will-let-users-block-ads-on-iphones-and-ipads/) [saw](http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/10/block-ads-ios-9-safari-iphone/) the obvious use case, proudly announcing "Adblocking is coming to iOS 9."

However, I think even more interesting than ad blocking is the ability to selectively enable features on websites based on apps you have installed. Imagine a website that has an "Install our app" script that normally runs when you view it on mobile, but that script gets blocked by their own app when it's installed on your device.

With a bit of creativity, you can do even cooler things than that once you think about content blockers like this.
