<p>To my surprise, this site came together rather quickly in the last 2 days. However, there is still much work left to be done, and I must currently shift my attention to another project for the moment. Therefore, in case you are browsing Metamorphium before I have a chance to update, please know that the following features are broken or missing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blog RSS feed</li>
<li>Blog Search</li>
<li>Add picture galleries</li>
<li>Add video gallery (waiting for <a href="http://sublimevideo.net/">Sublime Video</a> player to release before implementing this one)</li>
</ol>
<p>While most of the work so far has been put into advancing the hash based URL system, there is still a lot left to be done to make it more robust and expandable. My next goal is to allow better ajax integration, rather than only loading inline HTML content, as it does now.</p>
