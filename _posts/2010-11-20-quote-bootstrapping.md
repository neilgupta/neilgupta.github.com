> The things you do more often are the things you're going to get good at. So if you get really good at spending money, you're going to be really good at spending money. If you have to work on making money from day one, you're going to get really damn good at making money. And that's what you need to be as an entrepreneur...

This logic applies to favoring bootstrapping over getting a large VC investment as well. By forcing yourself to be frugal early on, you get good at saving money. When you take a large VC investment, you get good at spending money.
