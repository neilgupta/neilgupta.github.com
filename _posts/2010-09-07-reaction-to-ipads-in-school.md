<blockquote>
<p>Some questions or, should I say, assumptions commonly arise in these comment threads. I'd like to answer some:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Did my taxes pay for this outrage?</p>
<p>Not one penny of it. We charge parents a fee and cover our costs that way. Incidentally, those fees come out of money that's already been taxed to pay for that child's state school place that's not being used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you no longer teaching children to write?</p>
<p>No, kids are still learning to write. Consider, though, that a child starting school this year will not leave until 2023. Now think about how much you hand-write today and imagine how much less you'll be writing in 2023. I can't see handwriting retaining its privileged position forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you no longer reading books?</p>
<p>We're experimenting with eBooks and I'll report back on how that goes. I can guarantee you, though, that school pupils rarely value the "rich texture of paper". Most school books get printed on stock that looks more like a slightly stiffer sheet of Andrex than the weighty, luxuriant pages of a fine-art book.</p>
<p>Many printed materials for Scottish education are not availale in electronic form so, even if we wanted to eradicate the paper book, it will take some time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Won't the children lack "proper" computer skills?</p>
<p>Define 'proper', 'computer' and 'skills'. Now define them as commonly understood in the year 2023, which is when a pupil starting today will leave school.</p>
<p>I've never taught to specific software packages and never will. Of course, we have to&nbsp;<em>use</em>&nbsp;actual real software, but there's a big difference between "teaching Excel" and "teaching spreadsheets". Don't forget we still have MacBooks and iMacs too.</p>
<p>This is a constant tension in educational technology: do you teach for the current "business environment" or do you teach for learning? I prefer the latter. I'm not doing this just to produce the next generation of cubicle fodder.</p>
<p>A child graduating our school this year started school when the Apple Pippin was still current. How can I possibly know what specific technologies will be used in their career? It's beyond absurd to even pose the question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aren't you experimenting with children's futures?</p>
<p>Yup, but that's nothing compared to the experiment that all of Scotland is engaged in with Curriculum for Excellence.</p>
<p>This might not work. In three years we might not renew our lease and we could easily go back to a situation where kids get an hour a week using computers. Does that sound like it will be a defensible idea in 2013? Not to me.</p>
</li>

<p>This is actually a tamer reaction than I saw to my university introducing an iPad program. Why so much resentment and jealousy to changes in technology?</p>
