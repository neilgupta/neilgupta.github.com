Every developer has a list of tools and tweaks that they build up over time to increase their productivity. Here is a list of the little things I find useful to install everytime I set up a new machine. For reference, I am running Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, so many of these tools may be specific to that platform. I will update this list as it changes.

**QuickLook**

* [View plaintext files without an extension in QuickLook](https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen)
* [View image dimensions in QuickLook preview](https://github.com/Nyx0uf/qlImageSize)

**Sublime Text 2**

* [Install Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* [Install Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
* Install `LESS` via Package Control ([GitHub](https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime))
* Install `CoffeeScript` via Package Control ([GitHub](https://github.com/Xavura/CoffeeScript-Sublime-Plugin))

**Other**

* [Inconsolata-g monospaced font](http://leonardo-m.livejournal.com/77079.html) - because the default system fonts suck for code. Be sure to change the default font in Terminal preferences to Inconsolata-g 12pt antialiased, and in ST2 add the following line to preferences:

	{
		"font_face": "Inconsolata-g"
	}


* Enable "New Terminal Tab at Folder" service from Keyboard Shortcuts System Preferences pane
