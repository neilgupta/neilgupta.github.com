There's a useful little shell command posted [here](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/06/reading-time-in-textmate/) to calculate the reading time of a text selection based on the average reading speed. 

Such a simple feature got me thinking about all the places this could be used, like RSS readers or Instapaper to let me filter my articles based on the amount of time I have.

The most useful place I'd love to see this implemented is in my email client, such that it warns me if I am sending an email that will take longer than 30 seconds to read. That would be a great way to finally encourage people to [send shorter emails](http://five.sentenc.es).

**Update:** I threw together a quick Safari extension based on the above idea for Gmail. You can get it from [GitHub](https://github.com/neilgupta/Gmail-Message-Length-Checker).
