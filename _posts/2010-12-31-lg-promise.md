I was going through my old files recently, and came across a concept design I made in April for [LG's Design the Future competition](http://www.crowdspring.com/project/2283311_lg-design-the-future-competition/access/), and figured I'd throw it up here just to document it.

The LG Promise is a concept phone that uses RFID technology to replace your physical wallet with a virtual, more secure wallet. It also features new interaction models, such as a proximity sensor that displays and hides the on-screen controls when the user's hand approaches.
