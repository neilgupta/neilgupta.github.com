Quick update: I've redesigned the Metamorphium site to give it more of
a focus on some of my photography, rather than a boring grey
background [as before](http://metamorphium.com/old). I've also decided
to just link to my Posterous blog itself rather than using the
Posterous API to show my blog within my own site without Posterous's
branding. This was merely a decision of convenience, since I did not
want to deal with updating all of my code to use Posterous's new API,
when I'd rather be working on Tabule.

There's still a lot of changes that need to be made at the time of
this writing, and I will be rolling those out slowly over the coming
days. The biggest missing feature is still the complete lack of photo
gallery. I just haven't had the time to build a nice gallery, so for
now, I've just dropped five or so pictures that caught my eye in my
Aperture library into the home page (click on the Metamorphium logo on
the homepage to randomly cycle through the pictures without
reloading).

More changes to come. Stay tuned.
