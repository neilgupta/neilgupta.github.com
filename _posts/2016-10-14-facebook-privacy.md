Fascinating read from [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/10/13/497820170/the-man-who-stood-up-to-facebook):

> "Nobody up until that point had ever had, I think, the courage to publicly say to users that they don't control their data," he says, "and honestly Facebook didn't have the courage to say that."

This is something that has been on my mind a lot as I've started diving deeper into machine learning. We generate a tremendous amount of data everyday and that will only continue to increase as we keep adding more sensors and smart home devices around us. But we don't control *any* of that data. That's a big problem.
