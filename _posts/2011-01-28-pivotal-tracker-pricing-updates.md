I just received Pivotal Tracker's email regarding updates to their pricing plans that were announced last week. While their previous announcement was totally understandable (a company needs to make money), it was a bit of a bummer to suddenly see such a great free tool cost money. Their new email, on the other hand, presents a new pricing structure that they have modified based on customer feedback. I am really impressed at how they listened to feedback and quickly adjusted accordingly. I always appreciate dealing with a company that actually cares about its users, and their email just strengthened my support of their product and convinced me to stick with them once the pricing plans take effect.
