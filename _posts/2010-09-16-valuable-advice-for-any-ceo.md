> Innovation is almost insane by definition: most people view any truly innovative idea as stupid, because if it was a good idea, somebody would have already done it. So, the innovator is guaranteed to have more natural initial detractors than followers.

Ben is a partner in an investment firm, and he talks about lessons he's learned as a prior CEO and as an investor. I highly recommend reading <a href="http://bhorowitz.com">ben's blog</a> to any entrepreneur or CEO. It's full of advice and lessons that are better learned from his mistakes, rather than making them again yourself.
