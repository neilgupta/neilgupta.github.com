Aza Raskin, [discussing user interface
design](http://thenextweb.com/video/2011/05/10/apple-baby-aza-raskin-on-the-secrets-of-great-user-interface/):

> *"The society that separates its warriors from its scholars, is a society that's doomed to fail. Because if you do, then your idiots do your fighting, and your cowards do your thinking."*
> 
> The exact same thing is true of designers and engineers.

Raskin quotes an ancient Greek philosopher to illustrate why designers
and engineers need to work together to design great products, rather
than simply tacking an interface on top of an engineering project.
