> As the saying goes, it's not what you know, but who you know - and a startup called Namesake plans to capitalize on that mentality by providing a social network that gives users a way to  seek and promote job opportunities through the people they know - all in under 200 characters.

Namesake is exactly what many early start ups need. My biggest problem right now is finding people I know who have the skill set that I need. This is much harder than I anticipated, and I have been dreaming of a service that helps me find people easier. As [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/namesake-is-the-match-com-for-professional-opportunities/) puts it, Namesake is the Match.com for professional opportunities.

This service could really take off if they target universities where there is a lot of talent looking for ideas and a lot of ideas looking for talent.
