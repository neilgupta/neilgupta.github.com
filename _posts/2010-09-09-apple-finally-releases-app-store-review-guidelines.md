The newly released [App Store Review Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/appstore/guidelines.html) are an interesting, humorous, and surprisingly blunt read. Lots of good tid bits. 

However, the point quoted above stood out most to me. 

Medical startups are extremely hot right now, especially those that take advantage of the power and mobility of iDevices. While it makes sense that Apple would want to distance itself from the legal headache of life and death situations, this is going to be disappointing to several medically-oriented startups.
