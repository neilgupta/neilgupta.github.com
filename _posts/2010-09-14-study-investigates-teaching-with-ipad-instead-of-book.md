> One group is using the HMH Fuse app and a control group is using the standard text. As far as we know, this is the first time a full year subject matter course has been rolled out as an app. The study will be conducted by Empirical Educations Inc. an independent testing group, and will measure differences and similarities in areas of achievement and attitudes about learning. They also want to learn about how and if the students use the app the way it was intended. 

I am very interested to see the results of this study. This is the first iPad-related study I've seen that is actually collecting data in an experimental model with test and control groups.
