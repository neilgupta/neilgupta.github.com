The above quote is from Goldberg's Facebook profile. Goldberg is the founder of Campus Network, a now extinct social network that was once Facebook's biggest competitor. The story of why it lost is a great read and reminder of how important simplicity is in products. Rather than building a long bullet list of features, focus on a few core features and be the best at them. Then, iterate and improve over time.

For all the mistakes Zuckerberg is accused of making, he sure is a brilliant business man.
